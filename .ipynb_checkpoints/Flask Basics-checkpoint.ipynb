    "* __View__ : A view is a function that returns an HTTP response. This response has to be a string but can be any string you want.\n",
    "* __Route__ : A route is the URL path to a view. They always start with a forward slash / and can end with one if you want.\n",
    "* __Decerator__ : is a function that wraps around another function (e.g `@app.route('/')`).\n",
    "* __global__ : A global is a variable that exists outside of the normal Python scopes. It is available everywhere.\n",
    "* __query string__ : The part of a URL that comes after the ?. You'll notice that the information after this looks like keyword arguments. This is the most common way users send arguments and values through the url.\n",
    "* __request__ : request is a Flask global that represents the request that the client has made to your application. This contains things like cookies, the path, and, in our usage, the query string. You must import this Flask global with `from flask import request`. (side note: the fact that the request object is a global one makes Kenneth cringe, which suggests this is not a python best practice)\n",
